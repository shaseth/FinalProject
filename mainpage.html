			<h1>What are chatbots?</h1>
			<p> The modern day chatbot is a piece of software that uses natural 
				language understanding and artificial intelligence in order 
				to simulate having a conversation with another human. Usually, 
				a chatbot interacts with users through a text interface. 
				Generative chatbots, which we will be talking about on this 
				website, take human language as input, analyze this information, 
				and output generated human text based on the input text. Chatbots
				are not actually conscious, so they don’t “understand” what
				they are saying, but they can output text which we, as humans,
				can find meaning in and understand. </p>

		<div class="window closed" data-title="What can they do?">
			<h1>They can:</h1>
			<p> - Answer complex questions and converse with users without help from humans 
				<br> - Do very well on tests like the bar, the medical licensing exam, and a software test given to Amazon job candidates. 
				<br> - Learn how a specific user typically uses it, and adapt to this. This includes providing user specific recommendations and anticipating user specific needs.
				<br> - Provide answers to customer issues for businesses in a helpline-like manner.
			</p>

			<h1>They cannot:</h1>
			<p> - Provide information which is true 100% of the time. AI will sometimes confidently give incorrect information; this phenomenon is known as “hallucination.”
				<br> - Understand what they are saying.
				<br> - Purposefully come up with novel ideas. Chatbots rely on mimicking what humans have already done. If a chatbot stumbles upon what looks to be a novel idea, it is probably just a combination of other ideas.
